        <h2>What is a <em>Cannoli</em></h2>
        <p>A <em>cannoli</em> is a traditional Italian pastry that originated in Sicily.
            It consists of a tube-shaped shell made of deep-fried pastry dough, which is then filled with a sweet and creamy filling.
            
            The filling typically contains a mixture of ricotta cheese, sugar, and sometimes flavored with ingredients such as vanilla, cinnamon, chocolate chips, or citrus zest.

            <p><em>Cannoli</em> are often garnished with powdered sugar, chopped nuts, or candied fruit on the ends, and they come in various sizes. 
                The combination of the crisp, flaky shell and the rich, sweet filling makes <em>cannoli</em> a popular and beloved dessert in Italian cuisine.

                                Divide cannoli dough into three balls; flatten each one just enough to get through the pasta machine. Roll a ball of dough through successively thinner settings until you have reached the thinnest setting. Dust lightly with flour if necessary.

                                Place the sheet of dough on a lightly floured surface. Using a cutter or large glass, cut out 4 to 5-inch circles.

                                Dust the circles with a light coating of flour. This will help you later in removing the shells from the tubes. Roll dough around cannoli tubes, sealing the edge with a bit of egg white. Repeat with remaining dough balls.

                                Fry shells on the tubes in hot oil, a few at a time, until golden, about 2 to 3 minutes. Use tongs to turn as needed. Remove shells carefully using tongs, and place them on a cooling rack set over paper towels.

                                Cool just long enough that you can handle the tubes, then carefully twist the tube to remove the shell. Using a tea towel may help you get a better grip. Wash or wipe off the tubes, and use them for more shells. Cooled shells can be placed in an airtight container and kept for up to 2 months. You should only fill them immediately or up to 1 hour before serving.
