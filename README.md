# odin-recipes

To do:
This is my first project enrolled on the Odin Project.
The objective is to make a website made of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

--------------------
Update 30/11/2023:
After doing my first 2 simple recipes I can say I am a lot more comfortable doing anchors, images, ol and ul.
It's time consuming doing more recipes but excited to see what expects me on the next lessons.

Did some CSS on my index page, nothing too fancy, beginner stuff juts to be more pleasing to look at
