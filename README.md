# odin-recipes

To do:
This is my first project enrolled on the Odin Project.
The objective is to make a website made of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

Update 30/11/2023:
After doing my first 2 simple recipes I can say I am a lot more comfortable doing anchors, images, ol and ul.
It's time consuming doing more recipes but excited to see what expects me on the next lessons.
